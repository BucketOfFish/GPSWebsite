title: "A Geometric Interpretation of Simpson's Paradox"
subheadline: "by Dhruv Desai"
teaser: "Simpson's Paradox occurs when the average of one dataset is larger than the average of another dataset, despite all or almost all the individual members of the two datasets displaying the opposite relation. In this presentation, Dhruv gives a proof on when Simpson's Paradox may be applicable, using a geometric vector-based proof."
